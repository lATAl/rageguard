Hello, I thought I might as well make a nice project for the learning experience. I'll be starting development on a full open-source antihack in C++/Erlang. The idea of the project will be to create a good base for an antihack, using the most professional, efficient, and secure practices possible. I do not wish to adapt the project's libraries unless it benefits these 3 reasons, regardless of the community's experience with these libraries.

The warning for using this project is:
This project is NOT an anti-hack, it is an anti-hack base. If you use this alone/without modifications, it WILL be exploited. It is an educational project to create a very efficient anti-hack base for other servers to build upon/customize.

The first step will be a packet encryption method that will not increase latency significantly. I will be working on this tonight and I will post some code/info on the method I would like to use in the morning.
